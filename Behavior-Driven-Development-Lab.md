### OVERVIEW
Behave is a Python library for behavior-driven development (BDD). BDD is a software development methodology that extends test-driven development (TDD) by encouraging collaboration between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders like business analysts and product owners. BDD focuses on the behavior of a software system from the user's perspective and emphasizes the use of natural language to describe and document the system's functionality.

#### WHAT IS GHERKIN?
Gherkin is a plain-text, domain-specific language used to describe the behavior of software systems in a human-readable format. It is commonly associated with behavior-driven development (BDD) and is often used to write feature files that define the expected behavior of a software application from the user's perspective. Gherkin is designed to be easily understood by non-technical stakeholders, such as product owners, business analysts, and domain experts, as well as developers and testers.

#### WHAT ARE FEATURE FILES?
Feature files are written in plain text and contain scenarios that describe the expected behavior of a particular feature of your application. They typically use a structured format like Gherkin, which is a language for specifying behavior using keywords like "Given," "When," and "Then."
