### OVERVIEW
Behave is a Python library for behavior-driven development (BDD). BDD is a software development methodology that extends test-driven development (TDD) by encouraging collaboration between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders like business analysts and product owners. BDD focuses on the behavior of a software system from the user's perspective and emphasizes the use of natural language to describe and document the system's functionality.
