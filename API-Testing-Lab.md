### OVERVIEW
API testing refers to the process of testing the application programming interfaces (APIs) of a software system. In this lab, you'll harness the simplicity of Postman for manual testing and leverage the versatility of the Python `requests` library for automated scenarios. The information below is a step-by-step guide on how to help you get started.

### What Are APIs?
APIs are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.

### Step 1: Create a REST Account
To create a REST account, first navigate to this website: https://gorest.co.in

You can either create an account through GitHub, Google or Microsoft.

### Step 2: Create a Postman Account
To create a Postman account, first navigate to this website: https://www.postman.com

You can either create an account manually, through Google, or SSO.
