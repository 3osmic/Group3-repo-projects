## Project Overview

This collaborative project involves team members designing a series of Python-based labs centered around various software testing techniques. These labs emphasize code creation, comprehensive documentation, and thorough evaluation. Topics covered range from web automation using Selenium and Playwright to best practices in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD).
