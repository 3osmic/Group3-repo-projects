### OVERVIEW
Selenium is a great way to automate web interactions and perform automated browser testing. You can use selenium with multiple languages, but in this lab we will only focus on python. The latest version of selenium is selenium 4. The information below is a step-by-step guide on how to help you get started.

### Step 1: Install Python
If you have not already, you will need to install Python on your computer. To do so please navigate to Python official website to download the latest version: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

**Note:** Make sure to download the right file based on your OS, as well as adding Python to your system's PATH during installation.

The current supported versions for Selenium are:
- 2.7
- 3.5+

#### (IF YOU AlREADY HAVE PIP ON YOUR SYSTEM):
If you already have pip installed on your system, you can upgrade it by using the following command in either the command line or terminal:

`pip install -U selenium`

### Step 2: Install Selenium
You can install Selenium using Python's package manager, pip. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:   

`pip install selenium`

![pipCommand](https://github.com/3osmic/Group3-repo-projects/assets/113747615/e9cf1bf1-cda0-4ff6-83b5-e7f4389c208b)


Once installed, a "Successfully installed" message should be displayed.

**Note:** If you find that you have problems installing selenium on your computer, please navigate to the [FAQ](#faq) section of this document

### Step 3: Download a Web Driver
Selenium interacts with web browsers using drivers. You will need to download the appropriate driver for the web browser you want to automate. Such as Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.  
Drivers can be found in the following URL's:	

	- ChromeDriver: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/	
	- GeckoDriver (for Firefox): https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases	
	- EdgeDriver: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/	
 
**Note:** Download the appropriate driver for your browser and make sure to add the driver exe to your system's PATH.  
For more platform options please visit the selenium official website, and scroll down to browsers.
(https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/)


Once Selenium is installed, youâ€™re ready to create your first Selenium script!
### Step 4: Creating Your First Selenium Script 
Here is a simple Python script that opens a browser, navigates to a website, and performs some action with expected results:

If you wish to use a different web browser, just change the name.

**Examples Include:**
.Chrome()
.Edge()
.Firefox()

![FirstScript](https://github.com/3osmic/Group3-repo-projects/assets/113747615/083e734e-18ca-4787-8228-0384d1085194)

## Step 5 (Do It Yourself) - Basic Selenium Commands
Website used for these demonstrations: https://cbarnc.github.io/Group3-repo-projects/
<!-- Click a button -->
### Clicking A Button
We will begin by first clicking a button. Below is the command that can help with this:

	button = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "my-button-class")
	button.click()

- In this piece of code we are using Selenium to locate an HTML element on a web page using the class name as the locator. 
- It looks for an element with the class name "my-button-class." (Which is the name of the button's class in the index.html document)
- The located element is then stored in the variable `button`.
- After the element is located and stored in the `button` variable, `button.click()` instructs Selenium to simulate a click action on the button element.

Here is the full code provided in order for you to run it:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
import time
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
# Keeps the webpage from automatically closing
options = webdriver.EdgeOptions()
options.add_experimental_option("detach", True)  
driver = webdriver.Edge(options=options)
# Initialize the web driver (e.g., Chrome)
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
# Navigate to a webpage
driver.get("https://cbarnc.github.io/Group3-repo-projects/")
# Code to input goes below 
# Locate an element (e.g., a button) by its ID
button = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "my-button-class")
# Perform an interaction (e.g., click the button)
button.click()
```

1. Run the script
2. Fill out the message form
3. Click the "Submit Message" button for a surprise!

![popupMessage](img_5.png)

In the event you need to find the class name of the button:
- Go to the index.html file
- Scroll down to where you see the <button></button> tags
- The class name should be in the "class" section in between the quotation marks

<!-- Locate Elements -->
### Locate Elements on a Web Application
```python
from selenium import webdriver
import time
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
# Keeps the webpage from automatically closing
options = webdriver.EdgeOptions()
options.add_experimental_option("detach", True)  
driver = webdriver.Edge(options=options)
# Initialize the web driver (e.g., Chrome)
driver = webdriver.Chrome() # Navigate to a webpage
driver.get("https://cbarnc.github.io/Group3-repo-projects/")
# Fix the code below so that you can set yourself up to intereact with different things on a web page
# using the different find_element(By....)
element = driver.find_element(By.ID, "element-id")
element = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "element-name")
element = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "element-class")

```

### Testing Comment Text Area
```python
from selenium import webdriver
import time
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
# Keeps the webpage from automatically closing
options = webdriver.EdgeOptions()
options.add_experimental_option("detach", True)  
driver = webdriver.Edge(options=options)
# Initialize the web driver (e.g., Chrome)
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
# Navigate to a webpage
driver.get("https://cbarnc.github.io/Group3-repo-projects/")
# Input code below so that you can see  "I love this!" get typed into the comments box when this file is launched

```

<!-- Close and Quit the Web Driver -->
### Close the Web Driver Tab
```python
### Code for closing out the tab that you opened through Selenium
from selenium import webdriver
import time
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
# Keeps the webpage from automatically closing
options = webdriver.EdgeOptions()
options.add_experimental_option("detach", True)  
driver = webdriver.Edge(options=options)
# Initialize the web driver (e.g., Chrome)
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
# Navigate to a webpage
driver.get("https://cbarnc.github.io/Group3-repo-projects/")
time.sleep(5) # Pauses before doing next peice of code
# Before the pause is over open up an extra tab
# Code to input goes here
```
### Close the Web Driver Browser
```python
### Code for closing out the browser that you opened through Selenium
