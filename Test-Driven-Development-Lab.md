## LAB 03	UNIT TESTING WITH TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

### OBJECTIVES
- Understand unit testing using Python.
- Create pytest functions
- Provide details on commands commonly used in Behave

### PREREQUISITES
- Must have basic knowledge of software testing
- Must have a basic level of knowledge of the python programming language

## BEFORE YOU GET STARTED
You will need the following in order for your tests to perform correctly

- Create a GitHub account
  - Clone the GitHub repository
- Install a code editor
- Install python
- Install pytest

Examples of code editors:
- VS Code
- Pycharm (Recommended)

### OVERVIEW
Test Driven Development (TDD) is the process of using unit testing to write automated test functions before writing the actual code. To achieve this, TDD uses multiple libraries with different languages, but in the lab, we will be focusing on the pytest library with python. The information below is a step-by-step guide on how to help you get started.

### What is Unit Testing?
Unit Testing is the process of checking small pieces of code to deliver information early and often

### Three Phases of TDD
1. **Create precise tests**: 
2. **Correcting the Code**: 
3. **Refactor the Code**: 

### Best Practices

### Step 1: Install Pytest
You can install pytest using Python's package manager, pip. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:

`pip install pytest`

Once installed, a "Successfully installed" message should be displayed.
